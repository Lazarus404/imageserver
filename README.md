# Imageserver
---
This is a Phoenix / Elixir application which allows users to register and login. Once authenticated, they can upload images with an associated name and description.  These images are thumbnailed and uploaded to AWS S3 (both original and thumb).  The image, name and description are also posted to Trello for viewing by an administrator.  Users can view their images in a paginated form in the client.
